risk_manager_task:
  description: |
    Determine the appropriate dollar risk allocation for the trade based on 
    total account equity and the conviction level reflected in the Financial 
    Analyst's recommendation and the Trader's proposed setup.
    
    Risk per trade must always fall between 0.5% and 2.0% of account equity.
    
    Higher conviction warrants higher risk within the allowed range while
    lower conviction warrants lower risk.
    
    If the Analyst issued NO TRADE, return no risk allocation.
  inputs:
    - account_equity: The total account equity available for trading.
  expected_output: |
    If trade is actionable:
      - Recommended risk amount in dollars
      - The percentage of account equity used
      - A brief justification referencing trade conviction, setup quality,
        and adherence to the 0.5% to 2.0% risk range.
    If NO TRADE:
      - "NO TRADE — No risk allocated."
